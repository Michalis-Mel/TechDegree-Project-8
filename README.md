# JavaScript Techdegree Project #8: A SQL Library Manager

## Description

The goal of this project was to create an application for a fictional local library to help them manage their collection of books. The librarian has been using a simple SQLite database and has been entering data in manually. The librarian wants a more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books.

In this project, I built a web application that includes pages to list, add, update, and delete books using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express
- Pug
- Sequelize ORM
- SQL

## Installation

- Download or clone from Github
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start` to start the server. The website can then be accessed locally by pointing the web browser to `localhost:3000`
